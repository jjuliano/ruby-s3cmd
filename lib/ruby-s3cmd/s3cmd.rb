    #
    # Options common for all commands (where it makes sense indeed)
    #

    #
    # Recursive upload, download or removal. When used with del it can remove all the files in a bucket.
    #
    attr_accessor :recursive

    #
    # Force overwrite and other dangerous operations. Can be used to remove a non-empty buckets with s3cmd
    # rb --force s3://bkt
    #
    attr_accessor :force

    #
    # Specify datacentre where to create the bucket. Possible values are US (default) or EU.
    #
    attr_accessor :bucket_location

    #
    # Print sizes in human readable form.
    #
    attr_accessor :human_readable_sizes

    #
    # Include MD5 sums in bucket listings (only for ls command).
    #
    attr_accessor :list_md5

    #
    # Display or don't display progress meter. When running on TTY (e.g. console or xterm) the default  is
    # to  display progress meter. If not on TTY (e.g. output is redirected somewhere or running from cron)
    # the default is to not display progress meter.
    #
    attr_accessor :progress, :no_progress

    #
    # Override autodetected terminal and filesystem encoding (character set).
    #
    attr_accessor :encoding

    #
    # Enable verbose output.
    #
    attr_accessor :verbose

    #
    # Enable debug output.
    #
    attr_accessor :debug

    #
    # Config file related options.
    #

    #
    # Config file name. Defaults to $HOME/.s3cfg
    #
    attr_accessor :config

    #
    # Options specific for file transfer commands (sync, put and get):
    #

    #
    # Only  show  what  should  be  uploaded  or downloaded but don't actually do it. May still perform S3
    # requests to get bucket listings and other in formation though.
    #
    attr_accessor :dry_run

    #
    # Delete remote objects with no corresponding local file when syncing to S3 or delete local files with
    # no corresponding object in S3 when syncing from S3.
    #
    attr_accessor :delete_removed

    #
    # Don't delete remote objects. Default for sync command.
    #
    attr_accessor :no_delete_removed

    #
    # Preserve filesystem attributes (mode, ownership, timestamps). Default for sync command.
    #
    attr_accessor :preserve

    #
    # Don't store filesystem attributes with uploaded files.
    #
    attr_accessor :no_preserve

    #
    # Exclude  files matching GLOB (a.k.a. shell-style wildcard) from sync. See FILE TRANSFERS section and
    # http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-sync for more information.
    #
    attr_accessor :exclude # GLOB

    #
    # Same as --exclude but reads GLOBs from the given FILE instead of expecting them on the command line.
    #
    attr_accessor :exclude_from # FILE

    #
    # Same as --exclude but works with REGEXPs (Regular expressions).
    #
    attr_accessor :rexclude # REGEXP

    #
    # Same as --exclude-from but works with REGEXPs.
    #
    attr_accessor :rexclude_from # FILE

    #
    # Filenames and paths matching GLOB or REGEXP will be included even if previously excluded by  one  of
    # --(r)exclude(-from) patterns
    #
    attr_accessor :include # GLOB
    attr_accessor :include_from # FILE
    attr_accessor :rinclude # REGEXP
    attr_accessor :rinclude_from # FILE

    #
    # Continue  getting a partially downloaded file (only for get command). This comes handy once download
    # of a large file, say an ISO image, from a S3 bucket fails and a partially downloaded file is left on
    # the  disk.  Unfortunately  put  command doesn't support restarting of failed upload due to Amazon S3
    # limitations.
    #
    attr_accessor :continue

    #
    # Skip over files that exist at the destination (only for get and sync commands).
    #
    attr_accessor :skip_existing

    #
    # Default MIME-type to be set for objects stored.
    #
    attr_accessor :mime_type # MIME/TYPE

    #
    # Guess MIME‐type of files by their extension.  Falls  back  to  default  MIME‐Type  as  specified  by
    # --mime-type option
    #
    attr_accessor :guess_mime_type
    
    #
    # Don't use mime magic when guessing MIME-type.
    #
    attr_accessor :no_mime_magic

    #
    # Add  a  given  HTTP  header  to the upload request. Can be used multiple times with different header
    # names. For instance set 'Expires' or 'Cache-Control' headers (or both) using  this  options  if  you
    # like.
    #
    attr_accessor :add_header # NAME:VALUE

    #
    # Store  objects  with  permissions  allowing read for anyone. See http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-public for
    # details and hints for storing publicly accessible files.
    #
    attr_accessor :acl_public

    #
    # Store objects with default ACL allowing access for you only.
    #
    attr_accessor :acl_private

    #
    # Use GPG encryption to protect stored objects from unauthorized access. See http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-
    # public for details about encryption.
    #
    attr_accessor :encrypt

    #
    # Don't encrypt files.
    #
    attr_accessor :no_encrypt
